# CATCHYNAME

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. Recent algorithmic and hardware development have enabled Machine Learning models to power countless applications: we would not have advanced recommender systems, real-time ETA prediction in navigation systems, accurate translations, smart speakers, and God knows how many more handy apps and devices.

"Thousands" of articles have been written on the topic, and many of them give a great overview of datasets and models that can be used in those cases. Some are excellent: they provide step-by-step instructions to download and preprocess the dataset, train a model (from scratch, or fine-tuning a pretrained one) and evaluate its performance. Error analysis is a nice exception, way too rare. A few are excellent sources: [Jesse Vig](https://jessevig.com/) and [Jay Alammar](https://jalammar.github.io/) have written articles and created amazing tools to understand, visualize and interract with state-of-the-art models in domains ranging from Natural Language Processing to proteins folding.

Open source platforms, APIs and frameworks like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) have enabled thousands of researchers and practicioners across the globe to experiment with architectures and datasets without having to reinvent the wheel, boosting productivity and innovation across almost any domain. Open source libraries developed by startups like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and research institutes like [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) lower the complexity of implementing, training, serving and sharing machine learning models. Many more enterprises, startups, universities, research insitutes, and individual contributors work hard every day to improve and expand the set of tools, datasets and models available for everyone, and we should all be greatful for their great contribution.

For years, professionals in several fields have struggled to deploy their machine learning models in production environments. In the last couple of years a multitude of tools and principles have spread, meaning more and more models are now used in production applications, creating value for users and stakeholders. This though comes with a risk: many models are deployed with noone having a clear understanding of their inner mechanisms, limitations and risks.

CATCHYNAME is born on the shoulders of giants, without whom none of this would be possible. It aims to provide professionals and individuals interested into gaining a deep understanding of those models with a set of tools, methods and resources across social media. New research papers come out at a neckbreak speed, and new massive models achieve astonishing results. It is essential for the whole community to be able to understand them in deep, to be able to provide the highest value while minimzing risks for the whole humankind.

I want to thank in advance every single person which will decide to spend even a minute of their lives reading, listening or watching any of the contents, and contribution is much welcomed. This is the beginning of my communication journey, and I expect to make many mistakes along the way. Some might catch my attention, but without your feedback many of them will pass unnoticed.

Stay tuned. Go deep. Do good.
